# codewithacause
### Code with a Cause is a hackathon that benefits nonprofit organizations in the Greater St. Louis region. During this 48-hour event, teams of technologists (developers, designers, project managers) are partnered with a nonprofit that has pre-identified a specific software need. At the end of the hackathon, the project is then given to the nonprofit to implement within their organization. https://globalhack.org/code-with-a-cause-2018/
